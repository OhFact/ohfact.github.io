                    I started taking notes in my sophmore year at UW-Madison for my physics and mathematics courses. They are published here, if youd like to use them as reference. <a href="Notes.html">Course Notes</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These notes are imperfect, and if you happen to find an innacuracy you are welcome to let me know via my email.
